# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Master the Future of Embodied Intelligence

## 🎯 Course Overview

Welcome to the most exciting frontier in artificial intelligence: **Physical AI**. This course will take you on a transformative journey from digital AI to embodied intelligence - AI systems that understand and interact with the physical world.

## 🤖 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space. Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:

- 🏃 Share our physical form and can navigate human environments
- 📊 Can be trained with abundant data from human interactions
- ⚖️ Understand physical laws, gravity, collisions, and real-world constraints
- 🔗 Bridge the gap between the digital brain and the physical body

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

By the end of this 13-week course, you will:

✅ Master **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) for robotic control  
✅ Simulate robots using **Gazebo** and **Unity**  
✅ Develop with the **NVIDIA Isaac** AI robot platform  
✅ Design humanoid robots for natural human interactions  
✅ Integrate **GPT models** for conversational robotics  
✅ Build an **autonomous humanoid robot** for your capstone project
