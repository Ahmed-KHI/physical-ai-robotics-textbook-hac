# Project Constitution - Physical AI & Robotics Textbook

## Core Principles

### 1. Educational Excellence
- **Clarity First**: All content must be clear, concise, and accessible to learners at all levels
- **Progressive Learning**: Build knowledge incrementally from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- **Practical Focus**: Balance theoretical knowledge with hands-on, real-world applications
- **Inclusive Design**: Support diverse learning styles and backgrounds (beginner to advanced)

### 2. Technical Standards
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast load times and responsive interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interactive elements
- **Security**: Implement secure authentication, data validation, and API protection
- **Scalability**: Design for growth in content and user base

### 3. User Experience
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works seamlessly on all devices
- **Navigation**: Intuitive site structure with clear learning paths
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate, helpful responses to user actions
- **Personalization**: Adapt content based on user skill level and preferences
- **Multilingual**: Support content translation (starting with Urdu)

### 4. AI Integration Standards
- **Cost-Effective**: Use GPT-3.5-turbo for 20x cost savings vs GPT-4
- **Intelligent RAG**: Context-aware responses using vector search (Qdrant)
- **Accurate Citations**: Always reference source material from the textbook
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- **Privacy**: Never expose API keys or sensitive user data

### 5. Development Workflow
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Use Spec-Kit for structured feature planning
- **Version Control**: Git-based workflow with meaningful commit messages
- **Documentation**: Keep README, SETUP, and inline documentation current
- **Testing**: Validate all features before deployment
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatic deployment via Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)

### 6. Content Organization
- **13-Week Curriculum**: Structured learning path across robotics fundamentals
- **Modular Design**: Independent, reusable content modules
- **Rich Media**: Include diagrams, videos, code examples, and interactive demos
- **Up-to-Date**: Reflect latest developments in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

### 7. Collaboration & Open Source
- **Open Development**: Public GitHub repository with clear contribution guidelines
- **Community Support**: Provide channels for questions, feedback, and contributions
- **Academic Alignment**: Follow GIAIC curriculum and standards
- **Hackathon Spirit**: Innovative, creative solutions that push boundaries
